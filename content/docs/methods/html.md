# Basic Html

In the previous sections you set up a server or a static site deployed to netlify. Here
you start working with some basic html, with the aim that you are both able to recognize html
tags and able to manipulate basic html tags to your needs. 

## Resources
The resources available to learn html are copious and high quality. For example:

For a simple interactive introduction, try https://www.w3schools.com/html/

For a big online course: https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-html

Finally, concise but perhaps a bit more of an aquired taste, are the excellent
cheatsheet/tutorials at Learn X in Y minutes: https://learnxinyminutes.com/
