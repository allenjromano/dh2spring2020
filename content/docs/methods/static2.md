# Static Sites, part II

In the previous section we looked at how to start with a static site and previewed it on our local machine. Here we put it online, starting with some 
easy to use options and moving on to more complicated options after that. 

## Try it out: at a glance
1. Put your local site on github or gitlab
2. Deploy to Netlify from your git repository: https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-netlify/

*Server deployment:*
1. Set up an openbsd instance on vultr: [https://www.vultr.com/docs/creating-a-simple-website-on-vultr-with-openbsd-httpd](https://www.vultr.com/docs/creating-a-simple-website-on-vultr-with-openbsd-httpd)

It is appreciated, but not required, that you use my referral link for vultr [https://www.vultr.com/?ref=8369991-4F](https://www.vultr.com/?ref=8369991-4F)

2. The good old-fashioned way to deploy: copy your public directory to the server 

3. Optional: Automate your deployment. 

## The Details
### Git
There are numerous tutorials on how to get started with git. Among others, check out https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/. Those wanting a GUI might check out github desktop: [https://desktop.github.com/](https://desktop.github.com/). 

The following steps are all CLI based and assume that you have git installed.
