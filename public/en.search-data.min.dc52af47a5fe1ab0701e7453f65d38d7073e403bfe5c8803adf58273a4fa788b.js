Romano: aromano@fsu.edu / Diff 434 / Associate Teaching Professor, Program in Interdisciplinary Humanities\nOffice Hours: by appointment\nDescription This course covers topics in a variety of areas that might broadly be construed as \u0026ldquo;knowledge curation.\u0026rdquo; How do humanists organize, publish, and present online digital data? We will focus primarily on web technologies (starting with static site generators and then moving through basic server setup, html, css, and a variety of development tools) and work with databases and archives (relational vs. graph vs. document databases, Omeka and specialized tools for collection management). At the same time, we will ask questions about web technologies as humanities methods. Students will gain an understanding of scholarship and projects in related areas of digital humanities. The format is a mixture of discussion seminar, workshop and project-based lab.\nAlternatively, you may think of this course as full stack development for digital humanists.\nNote: While this course is in many ways a complement and continuation of DH1 (Humanities Data), both courses are independent and do not need to be taken together or in sequence.\nCourse Materials The majority of course materials are online. See the online course site for links and assignments\nStudents are required to purchase basic cloud hosting (specifically, a space for virtual private hosting) for development of their website(s). I recommend something like digitalocean, linode, vultr or where plans go for $3-5 per month. If you have your own physical server or would like to set up a raspberry pi or old laptop as a server from your home, then that is an option as well.\nYou may also want to look at (be aware of) reclaim hosting https://reclaimhosting.com/, depending on the needs of your individual project and work. However, reclaim is less useful as a platform for learning and so I recommend a more basic and no-frills form of cloud hosting.\n[Note on this: It is true that FSU offers a form of webhosting through webdav. However, FSU hosting, in general, sucks. Or, rather, it is not in line with the kind of tools you would have to deal with in most contexts outside of the university.]\nTechnology Requirements This is a class which will use a wide range of different technologies. Students should have a reliable functioning laptop for use in class and access to a reliable internet connection.\nStudent Responsibilities  This is a graduate class. It is expected that students attend all class sessions, complete all assignments, work consistently towards project goals, contribute to discussion threads on a regular basis, and come prepared to engage fully in in-class activities. The material we are covering will be alternately familiar, unfamiliar, easy to grasp, or difficult and requiring of significant practice and time. It is expected that students will ask questions. You are all encouraged to put aside your assumptions about being experts, actively combat self-doubt about how you should know everything, and allow yourself to learn through mistakes. You are free to check graduate school acculturation and pretense at the door. You do not need to pretend that you know what you don't or pretend that something is easy when it is difficult. Students in this class have vastly different levels of prior experience in both the content and technical methods of this class. You are encouraged to learn from each other and share such expertise. Students are expected to look critically (and with compassion) at their own current state of knowledge/skill/practice and advance from that point.  Grading General:\nThis is a graduate course. There are, in general, only three levels of \u0026ldquo;grading\u0026rdquo; relevant to this course: 1. completing the course satisfactorily, 2. completing the course with distinction, or 3. not completing the course satisfactorily. For this reason, the course grading is highly simplified:\nA: complete the course with distinction\nB+: complete the course satisfactorily\nC: complete the course less than satisfactorily\nF: Don't complete the course\nI expect that everyone can and should complete the course with distinction. In no cases should anyone end up with either of the two lower tiers.\nAll assignments, including in-class work, are equally weighted.\nSchedule We will proceed at the pace required for completion of projects and readings.\nPart 1: From html to the Jamstack\nPart 2: Databases to Metadata\nPart 3: Varieties of Collection: TEI, Audio, video, Storytelling\nThere is no midterm and no final.\nThere IS a course project for the semester, due at the end of the term before exam week.\nWeekly Assignments In class: we will work in groups to tackle a specific task. e.g. build a certain kind of website\nAfter class: you will work on your own to build and refine that resource for yourself (think second draft)\nBefore the next class:\na) complete follow-up readings from the previous class, including looking at any relevant projects and sites\nb) write up a brief bit of exposition/reflection/thought about what you've read and worked on.\nCourse Project  Early in the semester: Choose a collection of material to make your own. This can be an existing collection, something in special collections, or something you make up. Make sure you have permission to publish it online or otherwise do something with it publically Middle of the semester: Prototype what you would like the online presentation to look like. An exhibit? A digital collection? An archive? Static or interactive? What kind of metadata do you need? What kind of tools/interfaces? Build your site(s) for your collection  Course Policies This is a graduate course. It is expected that students attend all class sessions except in cases of illness or significant unforeseen circumstances. The university excused absence policy is listed below.\nUniversity Policies University Attendance Policy Excused absences include documented illness, deaths in the family and other documented crises, call to active military duty or jury duty, religious holy days, and official University activities. These absences will be accommodated in a way that does not arbitrarily penalize students who have a valid excuse. Consideration will also be given to students whose dependent children experience serious illness.\nAcademic Honor Policy The Florida State University Academic Honor Policy outlines the University's expectations for the integrity of students\u0026rsquo; academic work, the procedures for resolving alleged violations of those expectations, and the rights and responsibilities of students and faculty members throughout the process. Students are responsible for reading the Academic Honor Policy and for living up to their pledge to \u0026ldquo;\u0026hellip;be honest and truthful and\u0026hellip; [to] strive for personal and institutional integrity at Florida State University.\u0026rdquo; (For more details see the FSU Academic Honor Policy and procedures for addressing alleged violations (Links to an external site.).)\nAmericans With Disabilities Act Students with disabilities needing academic accommodation should (1) register with and provide documentation to the Student Disability Resource Center and (2) bring a letter to the instructor indicating the need for accommodation and what type. Please note that instructors are not allowed to provide classroom accommodation to a student until appropriate verification from the Student Disability Resource Center has been provided. This syllabus and other class materials are available in alternative format upon request. For more information about services available to FSU students with disabilities, contact the:\nStudent Disability Resource Center (Links to an external site.) 874 Traditions Way 108 Student Services Building Florida State University Tallahassee, FL 32306-4167 (850) 644-9566 (voice) (850) 644-8504 (TDD) Email: sdrc@admin.fsu.edu \nFree Tutoring from FSU On-campus tutoring and writing assistance is available for many courses at Florida State University. For more information, visit the Academic Center for Excellence (ACE) Tutoring Services\u0026rsquo; comprehensive list of on-campus tutoring options - see the Academic Center for Excellence (ACE) Tutoring Services\u0026rsquo; website (Links to an external site.) or contact tutor@fsu.edu. High-quality tutoring is available by appointment and on a walk-in basis. These services are offered by tutors trained to encourage the highest level of individual academic success while upholding personal academic integrity.\nSyllabus Change Policy \u0026ldquo;Except for changes that substantially affect implementation of the evaluation (grading) statement, this syllabus is a guide for the course and is subject to change with advance notice.\u0026rdquo;\nCourse Policies Multiple Submission Policy:\nIn general, you may not submit any work completed for credit in this course for credit in another course; you may not submit for this course that has previously been submitted for credit in another course at any level at any institution.\nHowever, due to the nature of work in this class, it is normal and expected that this work may form a portion of larger projects both in concurrent classes and future classes .The important distinction is that there has to be some manipulation unique to what is done in this class. If in doubt, get in touch and ask.\nSexual Harassment Policy\nIt is the policy of the University that its employees and students neither commit nor condone sexual harassment in any form. http://registrar.fsu.edu/bulletin/grad/info/university_notices.htm (Links to an external site.)\nVideo Use and Course Materials\nAll the course materials for this course are the intellectual property of the instructor, the teaching assistant, or FSU. They may not be distributed or published in any form without the written consent of the content creator. Videos from the course may not be distributed or reproduced in any form. In order to respect the privacy of your peers, any group work, assignments shared with the class, and video chats or group collaboration sessions are also not to be distributed or published outside of the course. Failure to abide by any of these guidelines will result in an F for the course.\nPlagiarism All work you submit for this course must be your own. This includes all assignments in any media, including video, audio, powerpoint, or any other in addition to written work. All work will be run through plagiarism checking software and I reserve the right to examine work in any medium for plagiarism at any point in the course.\nAny submission that shows any evidence of plagiarism or being not the work of the student will result in zero credit for the assignment and a failing grade for the course.\nDefinition of Plagiarism\n*Plagiarism is the use of other people's words or ideas without clear acknowledgment of the source.* Plagiarism is a form of academic dishonesty and a violation of the FSU Honor Code (see below). In written work submitted for this course, if you use any ideas or words from another source then you must properly credit that source with a footnote or a parenthetical citation. For example: 1. \u0026lsquo;While some may cling to the old-fashioned notion that \u0026ldquo;the force will be with you, always\u0026rdquo; (Kenobi 1977, 35), scholars have shown that the force is in fact a Derridean absence of paternity mixed with a Lacanian projection of lightsabertude\u0026rsquo;. Note too that even if you do not use the exact words but only the idea, you must provide citation: e.g. The force will be there at all times (Kenobi 1977, 35). You must provide citations for both paraphrase and direct quotation. If you have any questions about what constitutes plagiarism or how to use appropriate citation, please contact me.\nA better way to think about plagiarism*: The easiest way to avoid plagiarism is to stop worrying about “avoiding” plagiarism. You do not need to hide the fact that you looked to another source for knowledge or inspiration. But you do need to be clear about where your information is coming from. Footnotes and citations are a form of \u0026ldquo;showing your work\u0026rdquo;. When you write and have done some work reviewing primary and, if necessary, secondary sources, when you go to write the paper it does not (or, at least, should not) emerge out of thin air (so-called \u0026ldquo;BS\u0026rdquo;); rather, you put in order and bring together relevant items from what you have read in order to present your own argument. Citation of your sources allows you to show-off the work you have done. In showing your work, you also give your reader the opportunity to follow the same path you have and to understand clearly how you arrived at your conclusion. Citing sources is, above all, an essential part of making a convincing argument.*\nFor each assertion, ask “How do I know that?” If the answer is that it came from something your read or saw, then cite where you got it from.\nBottom Line: Your own rushed last minute or late writing is preferable to trying to pass off another source as your own. It is not worth the risk.\n"});index.add({'id':3,'href':'/docs/course/schedule/week1/','title':"Week 1",'content':"Monday, January 6 Introduction to the course; curation and collecting; how the web works\n"});index.add({'id':4,'href':'/docs/course/schedule/','title':"Schedule",'content':"Schedule Each week the main activity is a follow up on the previous class, extending and refining what you worked on and adding fodder for your thinking about the topics and technologies at hand.\nFrom HTML to JAMSTACK\nWeek 1: Introduction, Static Sites, Curation\nWeek 2: html / collections and archives\nWeek 3: html5 / UI, UX, and users\nWeek 4: css /\nWeek 5: javascript frameworks /\nDatabases and Metadata\nWeeks 6 - 10\nGenres of Archive\nWeeks 11 - 15\n"});index.add({'id':5,'href':'/docs/methods/static/','title':"Static Sites",'content':"Static Sites One of the fastest and easiest ways to get content online is with a static site generator. Particularly for textual content, static site generators like hugo and jekyll allow you to work primarily with markdown documents and minimally (if at all) with code while still having a fairly large amount of control over your site. The main advantage of static site generators is that they are incredibly lightweight and fast. Static sites are, as the name implies, static copies of the html and css needed to produce the page; they therefore do not need to be fetched or built by a server when someone looks at the page and so require minimal resources to serve over the internet.\nTry it out: at a glance  Follow the Quickstart guide for hugo. Try changing the theme from the default, in order to create a personal portfolio to show off your work. Some themes that you might look at include the Academic theme, the freelancer theme, the coder theme, any of the blog themes \u0026ndash; really, any theme can serve as a starting point. Add content and customize the page  The Details Set up Hugo MacOS  MacOS The instructions for Mac and Linux are fairly straightforward. For Mac, if you have not installed homebrew, then you should do so. It will make everything much easier: https://brew.sh/  Linux  Linux If you are using Linux, then you don't need me to explain it to you.\nFor the rest of you, switch to Linux (or BSD). It will make this so much easier.\n Windows  Windows For Windows, the steps are sometimes more complicated, particularly if you are not used to doing things on the command line or in your file structure. A few pointers:\n make sure to scroll down to the Windows section of the instructions familiarize yourself with your directory structure. Most likely you have a main C: directory but then your files are all in C:\\Users\\yourusername. This is important as you may get confused when adding the necessary file folders (C:\\Hugo, C:\\Hugo\\bin) in the instructions. to help get a feel for the directory structure on your computer AND to help learn the ocommand line, I strongly suggest that you open up your console (or terminal \u0026ndash; just search for it in the search bar or push the windows key while holding r, then type cmd). See hwere you are at the prompt (it will list your current directory). Then use the following commands to navigate a bit:   dir will list the contents of a directory cd followed by the name of a nested directory will get you into that directory cd by itself will take you back to your home directory (usually C:\\Users\\yourusername) cd .. will get you up one level of the directory (cd .... will get you up two levels, cd ../../.. will take you up three and so forth)    Create a site As you follow the instructions on the hugo site, a few notes:\n pay particular attention to which directory you are in when you run the hugo new site command. The site will be created as a subdirectory of wherever you are when you execute the command. you can set up a folder to hold your sites or for this class and then build the sites under that folder  View your site When you are done with setup, you will preview your site by typing hugo server -D\nOpen your browser and type localhost:1313 into the address bar to get to your site.\nIf you don't see anything, then there's a good chance you haven't added any content yet. Go find the content folder of your site. Also, look at the documentation for the theme and at the example site (usually hosted as a git repository as well) to see where files are kept and how they show up in the example site.\nModify content Note that for many blog themes you will find the content under /content/posts\nMarkdown A static site generator takes as input markdown files. These are a form of plaintext file that includes some basic formatting information. For an overview of markdown and cheatsheet, see https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/\nPlay around with it and see how formatting is displayed in the rendered site.\n"});index.add({'id':6,'href':'/docs/course/schedule/week2/','title':"Week 2",'content':"Monday, January 13 Follow-up from previous class: static sites and introduction to curation  Build and refine your own portfolio using hugo.
