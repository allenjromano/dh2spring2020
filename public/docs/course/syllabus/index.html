<h1 id="introduction-to-digital-humanities-2">Introduction to Digital Humanities 2</h1>
<h2 id="knowledge-curation">Knowledge Curation</h2>
<p>Mondays 3:00 PM - 5:30 PM-ish</p>
<p>Prof. Allen J. Romano: <a href="mailto:aromano@fsu.edu">aromano@fsu.edu</a> / Diff 434 / Associate Teaching Professor, Program in Interdisciplinary Humanities</p>
<p>Office Hours: by appointment</p>
<h3 id="description">Description</h3>
<p>This course covers topics in a variety of areas that might broadly be construed as &ldquo;knowledge curation.&rdquo; How do humanists organize, publish, and present online digital data? We will focus primarily on web technologies (starting with static site generators and then moving through basic server setup, html, css, and a variety of development tools) and work with databases and archives (relational vs. graph vs. document databases, Omeka and specialized tools for collection management). At the same time, we will ask questions about web technologies as humanities methods. Students will gain an understanding of scholarship and projects in related areas of digital humanities. The format is a mixture of discussion seminar, workshop and project-based lab.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you may think of this course as full stack development for digital humanists.</p>
<p>Note: While this course is in many ways a complement and continuation of DH1 (Humanities Data), both courses are independent and do not need to be taken together or in sequence.</p>
<h3 id="course-materials">Course Materials</h3>
<p>The majority of course materials are online. See the online course site for links and assignments</p>
<p>Students are required to purchase basic cloud hosting (specifically, a space for virtual private hosting) for development of their website(s). I recommend something like  digitalocean, linode, vultr or where plans go for $3-5 per month. If you have your own physical server or would like to set up a raspberry pi or old laptop as a server from your home, then that is an option as well.</p>
<p>You may also want to look at (be aware of) reclaim hosting <a href="https://reclaimhosting.com/,">https://reclaimhosting.com/,</a> depending on the needs of your individual project and work. However,  reclaim is less useful as a platform for learning and so I recommend a  more basic and no-frills form of cloud hosting.</p>
<p>[Note on this: It is true that FSU offers a form of webhosting  through webdav. However, FSU hosting, in general, sucks. Or, rather, it  is not in line with the kind of tools you would have to deal with in  most contexts outside of the university.]</p>
<h3 id="technology-requirements">Technology Requirements</h3>
<p>This is a class which will use a wide range of different technologies.  Students should have a reliable functioning laptop for use in class and  access to a reliable internet connection.</p>
<h3 id="student-responsibilities">Student Responsibilities</h3>
<ul>
<li>This is a graduate class. It is expected that students attend all  class sessions, complete all assignments, work consistently towards  project goals, contribute to discussion threads on a regular basis, and  come prepared to engage fully in in-class activities.</li>
<li>The material we are covering will be alternately familiar,  unfamiliar, easy to grasp, or difficult and requiring of significant  practice and time. It is expected that students will ask questions. You  are all encouraged to put aside your assumptions about being experts,  actively combat self-doubt about how you should know everything, and  allow yourself to learn through mistakes. You are free to check graduate school acculturation and pretense at the door. You do not need to  pretend that you know what you don't or pretend that something is easy  when it is difficult.</li>
<li>Students in this class have vastly different levels of prior  experience in both the content and technical methods of this class. You  are encouraged to learn from each other and share such expertise.  Students are expected to look critically (and with compassion) at their  own current state of knowledge/skill/practice and advance from that  point.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="grading">Grading</h3>
<p><strong>General:</strong></p>
<p>This is a graduate course. There are, in general, only three levels  of &ldquo;grading&rdquo; relevant to this course: 1. completing the course  satisfactorily, 2. completing the course with distinction, or 3. not  completing the course satisfactorily. For this reason, the course  grading is highly simplified:</p>
<p>A: complete the course with distinction</p>
<p>B+: complete the course satisfactorily</p>
<p>C: complete the course less than satisfactorily</p>
<p>F: Don't complete the course</p>
<p>I expect that everyone can and should complete the course with  distinction. In no cases should anyone end up with either of the two  lower tiers.</p>
<p>All assignments, including in-class work, are equally weighted.</p>
<h3 id="schedule">Schedule</h3>
<p>We will proceed at the pace required for completion of projects and readings.</p>
<p>Part 1: From html to the Jamstack</p>
<p>Part 2: Databases to Metadata</p>
<p>Part 3: Varieties of Collection: TEI, Audio, video, Storytelling</p>
<p>There is no midterm and no final.</p>
<p>There IS a course project for the semester, due at the end of the term before exam week.</p>
<h3 id="weekly-assignments">Weekly Assignments</h3>
<p>In class: we will work in groups to tackle a specific task. e.g. build a certain kind of website</p>
<p>After class: you will work on your own to build and refine that resource for yourself (think second draft)</p>
<p>Before the next class:</p>
<p>a) complete follow-up readings from the previous class, including looking at any relevant projects and sites</p>
<p>b) write up a brief bit of exposition/reflection/thought about what you've read and worked on.</p>
<h3 id="course-project">Course Project</h3>
<ol>
<li>Early in the semester: Choose a collection of material to make your own. This can be an existing collection, something in special collections, or something you make up. Make sure you have permission to publish it online or otherwise do something with it publically</li>
<li>Middle of the semester: Prototype what you would like the online presentation to look like. An exhibit? A digital collection? An archive? Static or interactive? What kind of metadata do you need? What kind of tools/interfaces?</li>
<li>Build your site(s) for your collection</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="course-policies">Course Policies</h3>
<p>This is a graduate course. It is expected that students attend all class sessions except in cases of illness or significant unforeseen  circumstances. The university excused absence policy is listed below.</p>
<h3 id="university-policies">University Policies</h3>
<h4 id="university-attendance-policy">University Attendance Policy</h4>
<p>Excused absences include documented illness, deaths in the family and other documented crises, call to active military duty or jury duty,  religious holy days, and official University activities. These absences  will be accommodated in a way that does not arbitrarily penalize  students who have a valid excuse. Consideration will also be given to  students whose dependent children experience serious illness.</p>
<h4 id="academic-honor-policy">Academic Honor Policy</h4>
<p>The Florida State University Academic Honor Policy outlines the  University's expectations for the integrity of students&rsquo; academic work,  the procedures for resolving alleged violations of those expectations,  and the rights and responsibilities of students and faculty members  throughout the process. Students are responsible for reading the  Academic Honor Policy and for living up to their pledge to &ldquo;&hellip;be honest and truthful and&hellip; [to] strive for personal and institutional  integrity at Florida State University.&rdquo; (For more details see the <a href="http://fda.fsu.edu/academic-resources/academic-integrity-and-grievances/academic-honor-policy">FSU Academic Honor Policy and procedures for addressing alleged violations (Links to an external site.)</a>.)</p>
<h4 id="americans-with-disabilities-act">Americans With Disabilities Act</h4>
<p>Students with disabilities needing academic accommodation should (1)  register with and provide documentation to the Student Disability  Resource Center and (2) bring a letter to the instructor indicating the  need for accommodation and what type. Please note that instructors are  not allowed to provide classroom accommodation to a student until  appropriate verification from the Student Disability Resource Center has been provided. This syllabus and other class materials are available in alternative format upon request. For more information about services  available to FSU students with disabilities, contact the:</p>

<h3 id="course-policies-1">Course Policies</h3>
<p>Multiple Submission Policy:</p>
<p>In general, you may not submit any work completed for credit in this  course for credit in another course; you may not submit for this course  that has previously been submitted for credit in another course at any  level at any institution.</p>
<p>However, due to the nature of work in this class, it is normal and  expected that this work may form a portion of larger projects both in  concurrent classes and future classes .The important distinction is that there has to be some manipulation unique to what is done in this class. If in doubt, get in touch and ask.</p>
<p>Sexual Harassment Policy</p>
<p>It is the policy of the University that its employees and students neither commit nor condone sexual harassment in any form. <a href="http://registrar.fsu.edu/bulletin/grad/info/university_notices.htm">http://registrar.fsu.edu/bulletin/grad/info/university_notices.htm (Links to an external site.)</a></p>
<p>Video Use and Course Materials</p>
<p>All the course materials for this course are the intellectual  property of the instructor, the teaching assistant, or FSU. They may not be distributed or published in any form without the written consent of  the content creator. Videos from the course may not be distributed or  reproduced in any form. In order to respect the privacy of your peers,  any group work, assignments shared with the class, and video chats or  group collaboration sessions are also not to be distributed or published outside of the course. Failure to abide by any of these guidelines will result in an F for the course.</p>
<h3 id="plagiarism">Plagiarism</h3>
<p>All work you submit for this course must be your own. This includes  all assignments in any media, including video, audio, powerpoint, or any other in addition to written work. All work will be run through  plagiarism checking software and I reserve the right to examine work in  any medium for plagiarism at any point in the course.</p>
<p><strong>Any submission that shows any evidence of plagiarism or  being not the work of the student will result in zero credit for the  assignment and a failing grade for the course.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Definition of Plagiarism</strong></p>
<p>*<strong>Plagiarism is the use of other people's words or ideas without clear acknowledgment of the source.*</strong> Plagiarism is a form of academic dishonesty and a violation of the FSU  Honor Code (see below). In written work submitted for this course, if  you use any ideas or words from another source then you must properly  credit that source with a footnote or a parenthetical citation. For  example: 1. &lsquo;While some may cling to the old-fashioned notion that &ldquo;the  force will be with you, always&rdquo; (Kenobi 1977, 35), scholars have shown  that the force is in fact a Derridean absence of paternity mixed with a  Lacanian projection of lightsabertude&rsquo;. Note too that even if you do not use the exact words but only the idea, you must provide citation: e.g.  The force will be there at all times (Kenobi 1977, 35). <strong>You must provide citations for both paraphrase and direct quotation.</strong> If you have any questions about what constitutes plagiarism or how to use appropriate citation, please contact me.</p>
<p><em><strong>A better way to think about plagiarism*</strong></em>: The easiest way to avoid plagiarism is to stop worrying about  “avoiding” plagiarism. You do not need to hide the fact that you looked  to another source for knowledge or inspiration. But you do need to be  clear about where your information is coming from. Footnotes and  citations are a form of &ldquo;showing your work&rdquo;. When you write and have  done some work reviewing primary and, if necessary, secondary sources,  when you go to write the paper it does not (or, at least, should not)  emerge out of thin air (so-called &ldquo;BS&rdquo;); rather, you put in order and  bring together relevant items from what you have read in order to  present your own argument. Citation of your sources allows you to  show-off the work you have done. In showing your work, you also give  your reader the opportunity to follow the same path you have and to  understand clearly how you arrived at your conclusion. Citing sources  is, above all, an essential part of making a convincing argument.*</p>
<p><strong>For each assertion, ask “How do I know that?” If the answer  is that it came from something your read or saw, then cite where you got it from.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Bottom Line: Your own rushed last minute or late writing is  preferable to trying to pass off another source as your own. It is not  worth the risk.</strong></p>
